# hw4-code-quiz

This homework assignment was meant to be a quiz with multiple choice answers. It should have a timer that begins when you click the button that says "Start Quiz" and counts down until it has reached zero or you get through all the questions, whichever comes first. It should then end and allow you to put your name and display how many wins and losses you have. Then the first screen with the start button will display again and you can do it over. I was unable to deliver this concept. I tried but when I sit down to code I completely forget what to write or how to write it. I will continue to work on it to give a better result, but for now I have what I know is less than acceptable, and I apologize. The things I WAS able to accomplish were: creating an html, css, and js file; changing my title; linking the css and js files to the html; hard coding a question and a few answers into the html; and adding a "Start Quiz" button to html. I began a few things in the js file but again I do not know how or what to write. I apologize again for my embarressing failure.
